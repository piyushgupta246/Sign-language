#Sign Language Detection – Project Description
Sign language detection involves using computer vision and machine learning techniques to interpret hand gestures and convert them into readable text or speech. This project aims to build an automated system that can recognize signs from images or video frames—typically captured through a webcam—and translate them into meaningful output, enabling communication between hearing-impaired individuals and others.

The system uses a real-time hand tracking framework like MediaPipe to extract hand landmarks, and a machine learning model such as Random Forest, CNN, or transformer-based models to classify the gestures. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of sign language gestures, such as American Sign Language (ASL), where each image or frame corresponds to a specific letter, word, or phrase.

Key components include:

Hand Landmark Detection: Identifying 21 key points on the hand using computer vision.

Feature Extraction: Processing these landmarks into meaningful features for classification.

Gesture Classification: Predicting the correct sign using a trained model.

User Interface: Displaying the translated sign as text or voice in real-time.
